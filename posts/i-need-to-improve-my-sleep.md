<p>Stay awake until 5AM has it advantages, as been possible to play with your friends the entire night, but also has it's own disadvantages, <b>as making your sleep a complete shit</b>. I need to improve my sleep, not just for OpenVoice but also for my studies and my runds on the treadmill (today i ran 8.15Km!).</p> 

<p>Also, i need to say something about LeetCode: I was afraid of starting it, of i not being able to resolve the problems it has.</p>
