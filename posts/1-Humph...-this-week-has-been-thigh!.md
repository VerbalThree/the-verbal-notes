<p>Last week i started to build a project that is a competitor to some sites that i've already visited before. 
The site that i'm trying to compete it's called "Packzin" (<a href="https://www.packzin.com.br/">link</a>), a social
media platform for dating (or kind of) with marketplace features to people spend their money.</p>

<p>But why i decided to create this competitor? Well, because the UX/UI of this site is <b>terrible</b>, and i'm not
exagerating. Literally anyone with a minimum notion of UI/UX can beat this website, and i'm willing to do it.</p>

<p>This project that i'm currently working on (besides <a href="https://about.ovapp.online/about">ovapp</a> that i still working on and i'll talk about it's state in the future) has a neobrutalism style, and honestly, anyone who isn't headless 
can say that my project is waaaay better than Packzin.</p>

<p>But there is a catch: isn't because of UI/UX that Packzin still relevant, it's mostly because of it's social features. Features like creating posts, comments, interacting with your clients and direct messages insanly makes people still use the
platform, and to make my project successfull, i shouldn't ignore that.</p>

<p>Well, that is it for now, folks. See you later.</p>
