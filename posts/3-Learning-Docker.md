<p>Today is 27 of February of 2025 and i decided to learn Docker. It's important
to note that <b>i already tried to learn Docker in the vacation</b>, but it was
pretty superficial.</p>

<ul>What i already know about Docker (some things may be wrong):
    <li>Docker is used to deliver applications kinda "faster"</li>
    <li>The so called "containers" (the packages) it's where your application will be</li>
    <li>You kinda can use Docker for deployment</li>
</ul>

<p>As i said before, some things may be wrong, so i'll be learning the correct way now (at least i expect)</p>

<p>So here is what i wrote in my notebook about Docker today:</p>

<p>Docker is a set of <b>platform as a service (PasS)</b> product that use <b>OS-level virtualization</b> to deliver software in packages called <b>containers</b>. The software that hosts the containers is called <b>Docker Engine</b>. It was first released in 2013 and developed by Docker, Inc.</p>

<p>Docker is a tool that is used to <b>automate the deployment</b> of applications in lightweight containers so that applications can work efficiently in different environments in isolation.</p>

<p>Containers are isolated from one to another and bundle their own software, libraries ad configuration files; they can commuicate with each other through well-defined channels. Because all of the containers share the services of a single operating system kernel, they use fewer resources than virtual machines.</p>

<p>As said before, Docker cna package an application on and its dependencies in a virtual container that can run on any Linux, Windows, or macOS computers. This enables the application to run in a variety of locations, such as on-promises, in public or private cloud.</p>

<p>Because Docker containers are lightweight, a single server or virtual machine can run several containers simutaneously.</p>

<p>If you are asking yourself: "Did he took it from somewhere familiar?", yeah i took it from Wikipedia, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)">here is the article</a>.</p>

<p>Also, i had the idea to create this post thanks to <a href="https://youtu.be/LGpJuDUaHXY?si=7EXCGJBy5Gi2Wwkj">this video</a>, made by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GutoGalego">Augusto Galego</a>.</p>
