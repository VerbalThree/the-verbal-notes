<p>Today i'm starting to write this diary and i'll treat it as a side project. I'll be writing primarily in English or any other language that i'm studying. I've never written anything like this before, and i hope to still with it for at least two weeks.</p>

<p>Okay, enough of this bullshit. Let's talk about OpenVoice and some other projects ideas i had this day (actually it's just one idea). <b>OpenVoice needs an algorithm</b>, it doesn't have to be like Instagram, Twitter or Facebook algorithms, but it need to at least recommend other profiles and posts to the user. These days (from 12/29/25 to 01/01/25) i've been thinking: <b>"How can a social media exist without at least a recommendation algorithm?"</b>. This thought have been stayed in my head for a few days and i've come to a conclusion: <b>"The initial idea of OpenVoice will not work,</b> at least not totally. Since the first day i started to work on OpenVoice i'd to change some ideas. For example: No ads experience. Projects like OpenVoice have a cost to maintain. For the first 100 users OpenVoice should be fine to not be generating any revenue, but as it scales, the free tools that i've used to create it should not be enough. I've been thinking to add a "Buy me a coffee" button at the onboarding and homepage of the website to not be so intrusive, instead of ads, as they can be intrusive and can't generate so much money, or at least the needed.</p>

<p>Now let's talk about an idea i'd when i was running on the treadmill: <b>The modern Napster</b>. "What do you mean by The Modern Napster? Napster still exist nowadays." Yes, you're right, but i don't mean to be recreating the Napster of nowadays, i mean the older one, of 1999 until 2002.</p>

<p>This will be an open-source project where the user will be able to access the website and without any authentication the user can listen to the musics and even be able to use an offline mode inside of the app. Being able to download the file (like a mp3) or to download the music inside of the website so he can listen offline through the app. Also, it's important to say that this project it's not supposed to make any money, i'm creating this project to fix a problem of mine, which is the <b>fucking Spotify free plan limitations.</b> This project will have at must a "Buy me a coffee" button to donate to me in case the user liked the project.</p>

<p>And to finishing the today's note i need to talk about LeetCode. Today i've started to study the LeetCode problems. The first problem i was feeling as a complete dumbass for not understanding the problem, but i get to know that this feeling is totally normal, i just need to keep up with the repetition.</p>
