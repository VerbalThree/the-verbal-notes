<p>When i was at my vacantion from school (2nd year from High School to the 3rd year), i watched a movie called "the social network", that represents the creation of Facebook by Mark Zuckerberg. In the beginning of this movie, it's possible to see that Zuck had a blog where he posted everything that passed on his mind. Was it true? I don't know. To be honest, i don't think that the majority of this movie have actually happened, but that turned on a lightswitch on my mind: Create a blog! (oh my god, so creative and innovative)</p>

<p>Okay okay, may be a bit overrated that i had an idea to create a blog, but that actually created on me a will to create something new. Something where i can share some of my ideas and even make this a diary of mine. So here we are, at <b>the verbal notes</b>.</p>

<p>I wanted to the a "terminal style" to this blog. "This blog doens't have an attractive looking, a good UI" Well, i don't think that a little blog of mine (basically a side project) doesn't need a pretty well developed UI. Honestly, i'm pretty comfortable with the UI of this website, which i basically copied from my <a href="https://verbalthree.github.io/VerbalThree/">portfolio</a>, another "terminal style" website. That is a style that i pretend to continue with my other projects.</p>

<p>I don't pretend to create daily blogs, or even create a goal to make more blogs, but i definitely want to describe some of my days, talk about some projects of mine and even talk about ideas.</p>

<p>I also don't expect to anyone see this blog, like "that is a blog created by someone very important, very famous!" No, totally the opossite. If someone see this blog, that will probably be my psychologist.</p>

<p>Well, that is it. I hope to get this blog going.</p>
